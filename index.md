## üëã About Me

I am currently a Master‚Äôs student (from fall, 2023) at the [School of Data Science and Engineering](https://dase.ecnu.edu.cn/) of [East China Normal University](https://www.ecnu.edu.cn/) and a member of the [Decision Intelligence Lab](https://decisionintelligence.github.io/index), advised by Prof. [Bin Yang](https://binyangdk.github.io/). 



## üîç Research Topics

My research interests cover Time Series Analysis and Deep Learning. I am currently working on foundation time series models, and time series benchmarking. In addition to pure research, I also dedicate myself to promoting research on valuable real-world applications. My research aims to contribute to the advancement of intelligent systems capable of handling massive and complicated temporal data across domains, including finance, industry, and environment.
